# OpenCV ISL Detection using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) 🌟

## Product Summary 🚀

Welcome to the Indian Sign Language (ISL) Hand Gesture Recognition System! This project leverages the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to interpret ISL gestures from images. By applying advanced image processing techniques, our system is designed to accurately classify hand gestures, making communication more accessible.

## Key Features 🛠️

- **Image Processing**: Utilizes OpenCV to preprocess and analyze hand gestures.
- **CNN Architecture**: Employs a deep learning model with layers including Convolution, ReLU, Pooling, and a fully connected layer.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves an impressive classification accuracy of 73.5%.

## How It Works 🧠

1. **Image Acquisition**: Capture hand gesture images using a camera.
2. **Preprocessing with OpenCV**: Apply image processing techniques to enhance and prepare images for classification.
3. **Feature Extraction**: Convolutional layers extract essential features from the images.
4. **Activation**: ReLU layers introduce non-linearity to the model.
5. **Pooling**: Reduce the dimensionality while retaining important features.
6. **Classification**: The final fully connected layer classifies the gestures into categories.
7. **Output**: Display the recognized gesture with the highest confidence.
